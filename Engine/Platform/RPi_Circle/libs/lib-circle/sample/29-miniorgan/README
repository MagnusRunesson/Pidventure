This sample is a simple monophonic mini organ. You have to attach an USB PC
keyboard to your Raspberry Pi to use it. The output signal is available on the
3.5mm headphones jack.

If you have a MIDI keyboard with USB interface, you can also use it to play. It
has to support the USB Audio Class MIDI device specification. This sample does
not support the MIDI velocity parameter.

You can also attach a serial MIDI interface to your Raspberry Pi (31250 Baud).
The MIDI input data has to be feeded to GPIO15 (Broadcom numbering) at 3.3V
level. Because the MIDI standard uses a current loop, you need a converter
circuit. Serial MIDI input is enabled, if an other keyboard is not attached.
The MIDI output is not used by this sample.

The mini organ uses the PWM sound device to generate a square wave of the
required frequency for about one octave (note C3 to C4). A more complex sound
synthesis using the CPWMSoundBaseDevice class should be possible.

The PC keyboard mapping is as follows:

+--------+
|Key Note|
+--------+

   +-----+-----+     +-----+-----+-----+
   |S C#3|D D#3|     |G F#3|H G#3|J A#4|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-----+
|Z C3 |X D3 |C E3 |V F3 |B G3 |N A4 |M B4 |, C4 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

The inscription of the keyboard may vary, but the physical position of the
piano keys is the same on all keyboards. Using this scheme you should be able to
find them.
